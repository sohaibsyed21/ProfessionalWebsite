        <img class="selfpicture" src="./images/self-pic.jpg" alt="Picture of Sohaib Syed" />
        <p> I am a third year computer science student at Illinois Tech. I am interested in the Data Science field and I
            am currently in the process of declaring for my co-terminal degree in Data Science. My hopes are that I will
            graduate in Spring 2024 with both my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and Masters of Applied Science
            in Data Science. </p>
        <p> However this home page is so you can get to know who I am besides a student.</p>

            <h3> Video Games</h3>

            <p> Video games is what I do to destress after a long day. It's only right that I mention it because its
                been such a large part of my life. The ability to play with your friends and escape reality for a couple
                of hours is what has allowed me to be mentally prepared everyday. </p>
            <p> One of my favorite games right now is called Apex Legends. It is a battle royale game that encourages
                strategy, teamwork, and communication. It has allowed me to practice my communication and team skills
                while doing something I enjoy. </p>
            <p> On that note <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJGF6kVOdVC3RtqKP66-QFA/featured"
                    target="_blank">here</a> is the YouTube channel that me and my friend record and post our videos on!

            <h3> Sports</h3>

                alt="A clipart GIF of a basketball spinning on a finger" />
            <p> I am no athlete, but playing sports is my preferred way to stay physically active. I love to play
                basketball because I believe that, at its core, it is an art. It is a multi-dimensional sport that has
                taught me a lot off the court. A lot of my strengths as a team player come form spending so much time
                playing basketball. It has also taught me about how to find the beauty in the chaos similar to how an
                NBA player has to pick and choose when to dribble, pass, or shoot. </p>
            <p> In my house a lot of NFL and NBA is watched, so of course I have favorite teams. GO BEARS AND GO LAKERS!

            <h3> Helping at my local mosque</h3>
            <img class="community" src="./images/giphy.gif"

            <p>My favorite hobby is volunteering at my local mosque on Fridays. In Islam, Friday is an important day,
                and the community gathers around noon to go to the mosque and pray. I take the time to go early and help
                with stuff like managing the parking lot, providing help to the elderly, and navigating people. I am
                very grateful for being able to do this because I like to getting closer to the community and bringing
                the community closer to itself. Being a positive influence to your community is a step closer to
                positively influencing the world. I hope I get to that point one day.</p>
