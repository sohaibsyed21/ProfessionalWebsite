My website is a simple, two-page site where the home page is an introduction to myself, and the other page is dedicated to my resume. The resume page includes a link to download a PDF version of my resume. The website was built with validity and accessibility as priorities. The CSS was used to increase accessibility, and also add my own personality to the site. My aim with my website, since it is my first, was to use it to inform people about the person that I am. I have the resume there as well, but who I am outside of school is what can differentiate me from others. The flexibility of a website allowed me to expand on the details of my extracurricular activities. 

If I had more time to work on the site, I would aim to make it look a lot better. At the moment I have it so that it meets the requirements and is as accessible as possible, but I would have learned some JavaScript so that I can make the content more appealing. It would definitely have been cool to have animations when scrolling, or a picture gallery of me helping at my mosque.
